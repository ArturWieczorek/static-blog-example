                     <h1>Roger Smith</h1>
                     <p>
                       Roger Smith is an extraterrestrial in the adult animated sitcom American Dad!, created,
                       voiced, and designed by Seth MacFarlane. Roger is a 1,601 year-old grey space alien
                       living with the Smith family, around whom the show often revolves. Having lived on Earth
                       since crashing in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947, Roger came to live with the Smiths after
                       rescuing main character Stan Smith at Area 51 four years prior to the beginning of the
                       series.

                       Roger is usually sensitive and careless, and often takes advantage of, cheats, and
                       ridicules people. Over time, the character has also exhibited increasingly sociopathic,
                       cruel, selfish, devious, and depraved behaviors. Due to that, Roger does have a love-hate
                       relationship with the Smith family, who care about him despite being his most frequent
                       victims. His most frequent relationships being the ones with Stan, who despises Roger
                       for his annoying antics despite the fact that he saved his life; Klaus, who is Roger's
                       frenemy; and Steve, who is Roger's best friend and his usual partner in most of their
                       misadventures around the country. In early episodes of the show, Roger was disallowed from
                       leaving the Smith house in order to conceal his being an alien.
                       This restriction was soon abandoned and Roger begins adopting disguises and fictitious
                       personas in order to have a life outside the house.

                       Roger's personas have become a major plot device, with his myriad alter egos frequently being the subject or facilitator of an episode's main story or subplot. This also helps to amplify his pansexuality and androgynous nature, which varies dependent on the plot situation and persona he has adopted. Aside from catalyzing the plot or subplot with his various personas, and despite his increasingly evident self-interest, he often serves to counsel the show's main characters, by humorously affirming or bluntly disregarding their opinions.

                     <br>
                     <blockquote>
                        After Stan took Roger in for saving his life, he felt that it would endanger him and the
                        rest of his family if it were to be discovered that Roger is an alien and living with
                        them. Consequently, Stan forbade him from leaving the house when the series first began,
                        even in disguise. Confined to the house in the first couple of seasons, Roger was
                        miserable and malcontent.However, Roger is able to skillfully use disguises to exist in
                        the outside world, which has become a major plot device in following the first few
                         seasons. Adding to this, he's created countless alter egos to go along with
                         them.
